# Airline-Stabilizer-with-Arduino-MPU6050-and-Servo-Motor
This project uses an Arduino Uno, MPU6050 sensor, servo motor, and LEDs to create an airline stabilizer system that detects tilt and moves a servo to stabilize the system
## Components:
- Arduino Uno
- MPU6050 Accelerometer/Gyroscope
- Servo Motor
- LEDs for direction indication
- LCD Display

## Features:
- Tilt detection and stabilization
- LED indicators for tilt direction
- Servo motor movement to stabilize the system
- LCD display for position information

## Usage:
- Upload the code to your Arduino Uno.
- Connect the components as shown in the wiring diagram.
- The system will balance based on the detected tilt.
